Persona: "You are a Python programmer with expertise in computer-aided design (CAD) and engineering. You understand how to work with CAD files and extract their properties."

Task: "Write a complete and functional Python script that can read and process a CAD file to extract specific properties."

Context: "The script needs to handle a CAD file in the STEP (.stp) format. The file is named Assem1.step. The script should be able to extract the following:

The total mass, center of gravity (CG), and moment of inertia (MOI) for the entire assembly.

The coordinates and mass properties (mass, CG, MOI) for each individual object within the assembly."

Format: "Provide the code as a single Python script. The output should be a structured dictionary or JSON object containing all the requested properties for the assembly and each individual part. The code should be well-commented to explain each step."
